This is a spectral processing project for my own research. Using **Python**.
Inlcuding:
- **ANOVA** processing for getting F-value, **band ratio image**.
- Convert raw spectral data (.spc .hdr .tif .spe .) to .csv file.
- 1D CNN for spectral classification.
- Spectral processing method such as **SNV**, **MSC**, **PCA**.
- (Recommended data processing lib **OpenSA**)
